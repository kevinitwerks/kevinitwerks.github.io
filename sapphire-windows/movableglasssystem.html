                <p>Our glazing systems come packed full of safety and practicality features such as:</p>
                <p>1. The specially-designed covered 8-roller system allows all panels to be opened and closed with ease while maintaining minimum friction and noise.</p>
                <p>2. Auto Brake Locks are engineered so that the when the panels reach the parking area, they are locked in place and impossible to fall out of the track.</p>
                <p>3. Anti-corrosion warranty gives you a peace of mind against the effect of weathering on the system.</p>
                <p>4. Hidden water drainage enables the system to collect and drain rainwater effectively and out of plain sight.</p>

The multitude of designs we have for doors ensure that there is always a design to suit your needs for your home.</p>
                <p>Glazing options are available from 6mm to 31mm, with the type of glass also as an option to you. Choose from either single-glazed float glass, double glazed, tempered or laminated glass to suit your needs.</p>

                <h3>Unsurpassed Insulation</h3>
                <p>Engineering tests carried out in Germany have shown that our doors are able to achieve a maximum STC of 40dB (40dB reduction in sound) and a maximum heat transfer coefficient U=1.6w/m2K.</p>
