                <p>Aluminium on the other hand, is a robust protective shield against the elements. Put these two materials together and they form an Aluminium-clad wood window which lasts generations without the need for continuous maintenance.</p>

                <p>UNILUX has always used the highest-quality materials. Down to the finest detail: instead of the inferior silicon, we use smooth glazing seals made from synthetic rubber. The high-quality workmanship and strict quality controls ensure you gain long-term enjoyment from your UNILUX window.</p>
                <h3>Brand advantage 2: Energy efficiency</h3>
                <p>Each of our aluminium clad wood products has state-of-the-art warm-edge spacers between the glass panes, ensuring better thermal values, greater comfort near the window, and significantly reduced condensation build-up during colder months.</p>
                <h3>Brand advantage 3: Safety</h3>
                <p>UNILUX locking parts are made from high-quality materials. Mushroom pins are also a standard feature of all our aluminium clad wood window fittings.</p>

                <h3>Experience the Difference</h3>
                <p>Sapphire Windows uses world-class systems developed by Deceuninck. Our windows have been designed with emphasis on security and simplicity. Innovative hardware technology ensures that you are well protected against all elements, both natural and human.</p>
                <p>The surrounding environment provides light, warmth and fresh air, and our windows are able to let these desirable elements in when required, yet remain secure and well insulated both thermally and acoustically when closed. The multi-chambered profiles of the window are the reason such insulations are realised, while the galvanished steel reinforcements located in the heart of the profiles ensure strength and security of the windows.</p>
                <p>Glazing options are available from 6mm to 31mm, with the type of glass an option to you. Choose either single glazed float glass, double glazed, tempered or laminated glass to suit your needs.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="right">
                <h3>Absolute Top in Insulation</h3>
                <p>Engineering tests carried out in Germany have shown that our windows are able reduce sound transmittance (soundproofing) and achieve a maximum Sound Transmission Class (STC) of 38dB. A maximum heat transfer coefficient U=1.6w/m2K is also possible, which is up to 4 times better than traditional aluminium windows. View our real world acoustic test at the bottom of this page!</p>

              data-content="
                <p>In contrast to typical North American sliding doors, the lift and slide type of door benefits from door panels being lifted on wheels when you turn the handle.</p>
                <p>Via this hardware, you can then push the door panel open, as it will slide on super thin metal track located between finished flooring.</p>
                <p>The super thin track blurs the transition between inside and out. Allow your interior flooring to extend all the way to the outside. The thin track is solid metal so no need worry about durability.</p>
                <p>UNILUX pocketing system has been created for today’s contemporary architecture with all the quality expected of UNILUX built in.</p>"

                <h3>Easy operation – easy vision</h3>
                <p>Lift and slide door systems can generally be constructed quite large. UNILUX lift and slide door panels are available up to 10’ wide and 9’ tall. Single panel sizes.</p>
                <p>UNILUX does not believe big sizes should come at the expense of high performance, either, thus all doors are offered with tri pane glazing.</p>
                <p>The lift and slide door system is of European origin. It is a prime example of the soundness of European design and robustness commonly found in UNILUX construction. Offered in both wood and wood/clad, in all colors and wood finishes, lift and slide doors are the quintessential large format sliding door system.</p>

                <h3>Here, nothing stands between you and the fresh air</h3>
                <p>Our slide and fold door systems take the quality you come to expect from UNILUX and combine it with sophisticated operation. Slide and fold doors are offered in any of our 5 wood species and are clad with aluminum on the exterior, for maximum protection. And because we always think about energy efficiency, tri pane glazing is offered with all systems.</p>
                <p>Typical slide and fold door systems are top hung, meaning the weight of door panels is supported by the header. This type of system often calls for an extremely large, robust header that does not allow the system to extend all the way to your ceiling. Not Unilux, our system rests upon the floor via two different thresholds.</p>
                <p>Available up to 25’ wide and 9’ tall, slide and fold doors really bring the outside in, and by stacking to the exterior, you have zero disturbance to end table, lamps, blinds or other furniture.</p>
                <p>When you don’t have room for a pocketing door system, slide and folds are a great way to open up those Maxxiglass panoramas.</p>"

The multitude of designs we have for doors ensure that there is always a design to suit your needs for your home.</p>
                <p>Glazing options are available from 6mm to 31mm, with the type of glass also as an option. Choose from either single-glazed float glass, double glazed, tempered or laminated glass to suit your needs.</p>
