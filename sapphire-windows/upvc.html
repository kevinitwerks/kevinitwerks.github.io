            <div class="texts">
              <div class="ten">
                <p>Unplasticised polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) is a modern synthetic material made by the chemical synthesis of chlorine and ethylene (carbon and hydrogen). The components originate from naturally occurring raw materials of petroleum and common salt.  Unplasticised means that the material has not been softened by the addition of additives called plasticisers. This results in a very rigid and stable form of plastic, suitable for load bearing applications. As the material does not contain plasticisers (i.e phthalates) or BPA, it is safe enough even to be used as mouth guards and retainers.</p>
                <p>The uPVC profiles from Deceuninck are produced and manufactured under strictly controlled environments in Europe and conform to all European standards. This results in the highly desirable properties and qualities of the uPVC profiles.</p>

                <h3>Excellent sound insulation</h3>
                <p>The multi-chambered profile design, double gasket seals and multipoint locking systems of the windows and doors can reduce sound transmission up to 40 decibels (STC 40), giving a literal meaning to the phrase “seen but not heard”.</p>
                <h3>High security</h3>
                <p>High-stability windows and doors offer the best solution for increased safety and security. Special fittings and glazings, coupled with elaborate locksets have ensured all attempted break-ins (5 so far) have failed.</p>
                <h3>Weather resistance and low maintenance</h3>
                <p>The excellent material properties of Deceuninck systems outlast almost every other building material in your home, meaning that they do not alter under extreme temperature or weathering. They do not warp, rot, corrode or discolour even in tropical and salty coastal climates. Tests have shown windows installed 40 years ago still look like new.</p>
                <h3>Efficient thermal insulation</h3>
                <p>The local climate can be too hot to handle. But with a very low thermal coefficient (up to U value of 1.6 W/m2 K), our systems are able to keep the warm air out and the cool air conditioned air in. This means you get lower electricity bills due to energy savings!</p>
              </div>
              <div class="three inline">

                <h3>Behaviour in case of fire</h3>
                <p>Rigid fire tests have shown that our materials, being naturally flame retardant and self-extinguishing throughout their product life, will not cause or enhance the development of an accidental fire.</p>
                <h3>Material & structural performance</h3>
                <p>With conclusive tests conducted over the past 40 years, the longevity and superior quality of the Deceuninck material compound performs to European standards for strength, durability, heat stability, colour retention and termite resistance.</p>

                <p>Deceuninck, through reasearch and development, have come up with Solex, a premier laminate that is specially suited for uPVC profiles subject to high UV lights and heat, for instance a tropical country like Singapore. Competing products have been known to peel off the uPVC frame, giving coloured laminated uPVC profiles a bad name.</p>
                <p>But you don't get that with Sapphire Windows. Now, with our range of Solex laminates, you can have a peace of mind as you choose the colour that will define the look of your home for many years to come.

                <h3>Experience the Difference</h3>
                <p>Sapphire Windows offers you a world class system developed by Deceuninck, emphasizing on security and simplicity in design. Innovative hardware technology ensures that you are well protected against all elements, both natural and human.</p>
                <p>The surroundings provide light, warmth and fresh air, and our windows are able to let these desirable elements in when required, yet remain secure and well insulated both thermally and acoustically when closed. The multi-chambered profiles of the window are the reason such insulations are realised, while the reinforcing galvanised steel located in the heart of the profiles ensure strength and security of the windows.</p>
                <p>Glazing options are available from 6mm to 31mm, with the type of glass an option to you. Choose either single glazed float glass, double glazed, tempered or laminated glass to suit your needs.</p>

                <h3>Absolute Top in Insulation</h3>
                <p>Engineering tests carried out in Germany have shown that our windows are able reduce sound transmittance (soundproofing) and achieve a maximum Sound Transmission Class (STC) of 38dB. A maximum heat transfer coefficient U=1.6w/m2K is also possible, which is up to 4 times better than traditional aluminium windows. View our real world acoustic test at the bottom of this page!</p>
